<!--BEGINNING of DL for 10 FAQs-->
<dl>
    <dt>Think about what type of dog fits into your lifestyle?</dt>
    <dd>Maybe a puppy isn't what you're looking for. There are lots of adult and senior dogs in need of loving, forever
        homes, too; and one of them may be the perfect dog for you! Take the time to consider your lifestyle, activity
        level, and patience before adopting. Likewise, research what breeds will match your life best and adopt
        accordingly.
    </dd>

    <dt>A Pet-Proof Home</dt>
    <dd>Make sure that your dog can’t get a hold of any wires, remotes, shoes, or poisonous plants that he or she can
        chew and possibly eat. These household items can cause potential threats to your pet’s health (and be costly to
        remove).
    </dd>

    <dt>Start training ASAP!</dt>
    <dd>You don’t have to wait until your dog is six-months old before you start teaching him or her how to sit, come,
        stay, and walk on a leash. Likewise, invest some time in training new-to-you adult dogs, too. The time you take
        opening the lines of communication now will benefit you both for years to come.
    </dd>


    <dt>Training with the right attitude</dt>
    <dd>When training your dog, always use voice commands and visual cues. Never resort to hitting your pet in order to
        teach him or her to obey. This will only make your dog defensive and harder to train. Using voice commands and
        positive rewards will allow you to train your pet more quickly and easily.
    </dd>

    <dt>Make friends!</dt>
    <dd>Socialization is very important for dogs, especially young pups. Allow your new pet to interact with other
        people, animals, and places during his or her young life so that he or she is less afraid of new people and
        situations.
    </dd>

    <dt>Avoiding bad habits</dt>
    <dd>Bad habits are easy to start, but difficult to break. Avoid feeding people food to your pet from the table,
        sharing your bed, or allowing your pet to jump up on people from the get go. You’ll be glad you invested the
        time from the start.
    </dd>

    <dt>Hygiene</dt>
    <dd>Keep your pet groomed and well-nourished. Feed your pet a pet food that is specifically designed for his or her
        life stage and breed, and allow your pet continual access to plenty of water. Dogs with longer hair should be
        brushed daily or weekly, and all pets should be checked regularly for pests, such as ticks or fleas.
    </dd>

    <dt>Find a Primary Care Veterinarian</dt>
    <dd>Your pet’s health is very important, and regular visits to the vet are a major part of being a responsible pet
        owner. Your veterinarian is dedicated to ensuring your pet remains happy and healthy throughout his or her life,
        so heed your vet’s advice when whenever it is given.
    </dd>

    <dt>Exercise! Exercise! Exercise!</dt>
    <dd>The physical health of your pet is just as important as his or her internal health. Ensure your pet gets the
        exercise he or she needs by taking regular walks or playing in the backyard with your dog, or installing a nice
        cat tower compete with scratching post and platforms.
    </dd>

    <dt>This is 'FOREVER'</dt>
    <dd>When you adopt a pet, you are making a life-long commitment. As your pet ages, he or she will need you more the
        ever, right up to the very end. Please don’t adopt unless you’re prepared to hold your pet’s paw as he or she
        passes.
    </dd>
