    "content": "Maybe a puppy isn't what you're looking for. There are lots of adult and senior dogs in need of loving, forever homes, too; and one of them may be the perfect dog for you! Take the time to consider your lifestyle, activity level, and patience before adopting. Likewise, research what breeds will match your life best and adopt accordingly. Make sure that your dog can’t get a hold of any wires, remotes, shoes, or poisonous plants that they can chew and possibly eat. These household items can cause potential threats to your pet’s health (and be costly to remove).",
